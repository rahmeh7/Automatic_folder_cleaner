# Automatic_folder_cleaner
The Automatic Folder Cleaner project is a tool that helps users to automatically organize their computer files and folders. The tool automatically scans designated folders and moves files to the appropriate location based on file type, name, or other criteria. This helps to keep the computer's file system organized and clutter-free.

The project is typically implemented as a script or application that runs in the background and periodically checks the designated folders for new files. When a new file is detected, the tool will apply a set of rules to determine where the file should be moved. For example, an image file might be moved to a folder labeled "Pictures," while a document file might be moved to a folder labeled "Documents."

Users can customize the rules to fit their specific needs. They can set up rules based on file type, size, date, and other criteria. They can also specify exceptions to the rules, such as files that should never be moved or folders that should not be scanned.

The benefits of an automatic folder cleaner project include:

Increased organization: Files are automatically moved to the appropriate location, reducing clutter and making it easier to find files.

Time-saving: Users no longer have to manually organize files, saving time and reducing the risk of human error.

Customization: Users can customize the rules to fit their specific needs and preferences.

Automation: The tool runs in the background and requires no user intervention, making it a hassle-free solution to file organization.

Overall, the Automatic Folder Cleaner project is a useful tool for anyone looking to keep their computer files organized and easily accessible.

#OS Module
This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. If you just want to read or write a file see open(), if you want to manipulate paths, see the os.path module, and if you want to read all the lines in all the files on the command line see the fileinput module. For creating temporary files and directories see the tempfile module, and for high-level file and directory handling see the shutil module.
